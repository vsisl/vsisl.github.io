# Let me help you make sense of your data

Today, every business produces data but only few make a good use of it. Using data is critical for the success of your business because it allows you to **make informed decisions**. 

My role is to help you to: 
- manage and organize your data,
- analyze your data to gain valuable insights.

## Clean energy

Data is my first professional passion. Sustainable energy is the second one. I am constantly seeking opportunities on the intersection of these two fields to drive positive change in the world. Nevertheless, I am open and happy to help you with data from any other areas as well.

# Tech stack

These are the technologies I work most often with:

Linux, Docker, Python (Numpy, Pandas, Vaex, Plotly, Plotly Dash, Celery), HDF5, Redis, Jupyter

## Data management and analytics tools for complex numerical datasets

In one of my recent projects, I developed a comprehensive data management and analytics solution for complex numerical datasets. This involved creating a custom database solution based on the [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) technology for storing 3D numerical fields, as well as building a Python library for effective retrieval and analysis of the data.

Alongside the database, I also created a data-centric web application (a dashboard) serving as an intuitive user interface for browsing and analyzing the data. The web app was based on the [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) framework and included a module for launching optimization tasks, which are executed asynchronously with results presented within the app.

To cater to more advanced and customized data analytics tasks, I deployed a computational platform based on [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) as a complementary data analytics solution further enhancing the overall capabilities of the system.

## Processing large volumes of text files

In another project, I dealt with processing large volumes (hundreds of thousands) of text files containing tabular data in fixed-width format. I built a pipeline that extracted, validated, and transformed the data before storing them to a centralized database. 

With the database in place, I proceeded with generating summaries and analyses as requested by the client. Using the [Vaex](https://vaex.io/) library as an alternative to [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) allowed to process datasets of the order of magnitude of 500 million rows and 50 GB of disk size on commodity-grade hardware.
